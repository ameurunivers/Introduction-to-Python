The purpose of this workspace is to allow you to experiment with the data from [Introduction to Python](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science) and practice your newly learned skills with some challenges. You can find out more about DataCamp Workspace [here](https://workspace-docs.datacamp.com/getting-started).\n",
